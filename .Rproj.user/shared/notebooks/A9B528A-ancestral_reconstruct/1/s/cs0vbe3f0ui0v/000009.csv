"0","# to display the node values, ggtree expects a vector where each element"
"0","# corresponds to each node in the tree, both at the tips and at the internal "
"0","# nodes. Since we don't have values for the internal nodes, we will pad them "
"0","# with NA (Not Available) for now."
"0","node_values = c(portulacaData, rep(NA, n_tips-1))"
"0","portulaca_ggtree + "
