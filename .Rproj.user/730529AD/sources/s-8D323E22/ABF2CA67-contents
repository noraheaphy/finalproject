## Data cleaning

- First to get all the taxa names in the character data matrix and the phylogeny tip labels into the format *Genus_species*

- Then drop the tips from the tree that don't have an equivalent in the character data (which is many of them) with `drop.tip`

- Then remove the character data rows that don't have an equivalent in the tree with `dplyr`

- Then use this line from exercise 10 to get the character data rows into the right order to map onto the tips: `geoData = geoData[ match( row.names(geoData), geoTree$tip.label  ), ]`

```{r}

# read in tree file
portulacaTree <- read.tree("data/Ocampo_Portulaca.parts.treefile")

# read in character data
portulacaData <- read.csv("data/portulaca_means_11-06-2020.csv", header = TRUE, 
                          sep = ",", na.strings = "")

portulacaTree$tip.label = portulacaTree$tip.label %>%
  str_replace("-.*","") %>%
  str_replace("_", " ")

# make dataframe of species names from character data
species_character <- data.frame(portulacaData$species) %>%
  rename(names = portulacaData.species)

# make dataframe of species names from tip labels
species_tree <- data.frame(portulacaTree$tip.label) %>%
  rename(names = portulacaTree.tip.label)

# pull out the names in the tree but not the character data
names_to_drop <- setdiff(species_tree, species_character)
names_to_drop <- names_to_drop$names # make into a vector

# remove tips that don't have character data matches
portulacaTree <- drop.tip(portulacaTree, names_to_drop)
portulacaTree <- drop.tip(portulacaTree, c(9, 4)) # pseudo-monophyletic duplicates

# now remove rows from character data frame that don't correspond to tips
species_tree <- data.frame(portulacaTree$tip.label) %>%
  rename(names = portulacaTree.tip.label)

names_to_drop <- setdiff(species_character, species_tree)
names_to_drop <- names_to_drop$names # make into a vector

portulacaData <- portulacaData[!(portulacaData$species %in% names_to_drop),] 

### temporary! fix later!
# remove P. halimoides and P. pusilla from both tree and character data
portulacaTree <- drop.tip(portulacaTree, c("Portulaca halimoides", "Portulaca pusilla"))
portulacaData <- portulacaData %>% filter(species != "Portulaca halimoides" &
                                            species != "Portulaca pusilla")

# last check


if(! length(portulacaTree$tip.label) == nrow(portulacaData)) {
      stop("Error: different numbers of taxa in tip labels and character data!")
} else {
  print("All good, continue!")
}

# save this cleaned character data
write.csv(portulacaData, "portulaca_means_mapping.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

Question for Casey & Lauren: How should I deal with a handful of taxa showing up as non-monophyletic? P. pusilla and P. halimoides show up in completely different parts of the tree. P. quadrifida and P. amilis are (not really) monophyletic once I drop tips I don't have character data for, so they just need to be combined into a single tip.

# double check that labels are the same, in case some were missing or duplicated
