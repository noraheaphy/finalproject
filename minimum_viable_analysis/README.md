### Steps of project

**1. Climate data aquisition:** I will download all available specimen collection records for Portulaca, Anacampserotaceae, Cactaceae, Talinum, and Calandrinia from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), supplemented with localities from other databases such as iDigBio and the Australian Virtual Herbarium. I will then thoroughly curate these records using the R package Coordinate Cleaner to remove erroneous localities, and I will verify taxonomic names to the fullest extent possible using the most plausible published phylogenies of these lineages. I will also exclude records from P. oleracea, P. pilosa, T. paniculatum, and T. fruticosum, as these are globally widespread weeds that would necessarily skew analyses of climatic niche. I will then download environmental data in the form of global raster layers from CHELSA and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, supplementing the standard 19 bioclimatic variables with data on potential evapotranspiration and aridity index. I will then extract environmental data for each specimen locality in ArcGIS Pro. All analyses will be conducted over a spatial resolution of 1 km<sup>2</sup> under the geodetic datum WGS84.

**2. Molecular data acquisition:** I will obtain the full data matrix of genes and taxa assembled by Ocampo & Columbus (2012), comprising 80 samples of Portulaca, representing 59 species, 10 subspecies, 3 cultivars, and 3 outgroups from Cactaceae, Talinaceae, and Montiaceae. The matrix includes nuclear ribosomal DNA loci (ITS, comprising ITS1, the 5.8S gene, and ITS2) and chloroplast DNA loci (protein-coding *ndhF*, *trnT-psbD* intergenic spacer, and *ndhA* intron. The P. oleracea species complex, which is taxonomically complicated and contested, is considered at the subspecies level. I will obtain the full baits data matrix for Portullugo from the Edwards Lab and subset this dataset to the Anacampserotaceae taxa and a few outgroups from Cactaceae and Talinaceae. I will then trim the taxa list to only include those for which I have both climate data and molecular data.
